## Description

Have you and your friends ever struggled to think of where to eat? We plan to create a restaurant review Android App localized to New York City and focusing on the college student demographic. Users will be able to view reviews of local restaurants by fellow students and create an account to write reviews. 

Our review system, will allow users to give a rating out of 10 as well as write a text review highlighting various aspects of their experience.

We also allow users to review restaurants, and use their past history of what kinds of restaurants they have reviewed positively, to make advanced recommendations on where they can eat. These recommendations will be sent out as push notifications daily, which is something unique to our app

Something more unique to our app, is that we will have a budgeting feature that will allow the user to enter a weekly/monthly budget. After visiting a restaurant, they can enter how much they spent there on a given day. Our recommendations will be focused on trying to satisfy their needs while also staying under budget.

Finally, we allow restaurants to update their pages in the app and to view reviews to improve themselves. They also, can post any promotions such as discounts or new items on their page to garner more interest.

## Usefulness

We created this idea out of a struggle to agree on where to eat while also staying under a given budget. This app was created to address that idea. Yelp is a similar website but this app serves a more unique purpose in helping with budgeting and direct recommendations. By parsing reviews and your past feedback, this app will try to provide the most custom recommendations to each user, and also allow them to explore the restaurants by category, price, and reviews to make better decisions for a more satisfying meal. 

## Realness

By using real data on the restaurants gathered from the Yelp or Zomato API, we will have accurate data on each restaurant’s pages. Furthermore, as restaurants can update their pages and users can add reviews/favorites, we will have more real data corresponding to each restaurant.

## Functionality
Basic functions:

-Use Zomato API/ Yelp API to pull real data for all restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area.

-Create an account that allows users to store some personal information.

-With an account, write reviews for local restaurants by assigning a score on 1-10 and by writing a text description

-Also, can favorite restaurants

-View profiles of local restaurants and have access to information on reviews and basic 	information on them.

-Allow verified restaurant owners to access their profiles, edit their descriptions and display promotions. 

-Users can also add promotions at a restaurant on a given day/time.

### Advanced Functions
-Budgeting System: Unique from other restaurant review apps, we want to allow the user to be able to enter a weekly/monthly budget. Then whenever they visit a restaurant, they can input how much they spend on that given meal. Using this data, we will try to tailor our recommendations (other advanced feature) strongly to stay under budget. We also will create graph visualizations for their spending habits from past weeks/months and help them analyze if they should consider increasing/decreasing their budget or ways they could stay under their budget (it seems like you are spending a lot on weekend nights, which are causing you to go over your budget). This way we serve as more than just a review app by being directly involved in the user’s day-to-day financial decisions.

-Recommendations: Given a users profile we can recommend them restaurants that match closely to what they have liked in the past. On the most basic level, we could match restaurant’s tags, like Greek, halal, cheap, popular, to restaurants the user has rated well in the past. Our bigger goal would be to develop an algorithm or model to try to guess what restaurants the user may like beyond just straightforward tagging. Like predicting that they’ll like a newly opened Mexican fast-food restaurant near by given most of their reviews have been about cheaper fast food restaurants. Our recommendations will also take into account how much of their budget is left, so we try our best to help them stay under budget.
